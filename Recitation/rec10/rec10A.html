I decided to remove this. Students seem to see the point without being
forced to "have a discussion". TA's are welcome to hold such
discussions if they feel they are beneficial.

      The group will discuss and solve the design phase for both PARTs
      before anyone starts writing code.</p>

    <p>
      We are writing code to model for a Musical Instrument Lending
      Library and some musicians.</p>

    <p>
      Our MIL<sup>2</sup> (Musical Instrument Lending Library)
      provides the musicians in this land with instruments. It's sort
      of like an old-style <code>C</code>ommunist system in that any
      musician can go to the MIL<sup>2</sup> and get an instrument for
      no charge (but they have no choice in what kind of instrument
      the get!).  Musicians will return their instrument to the
      MIL<sup>2</sup> at some point.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When the MIL<sup>2</sup> receives an instrument, 
        <ul>
          <li>
            it first tests the instrument by making a sound on it (see
            the section &quot;Making Sound&quot; below)
          <li>
            then places that instrument in its inventory <em>at the
            first available place</em> in the inventory.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                (it doesn't actually place the instrument itself, of
                course. The instrument exists outside the MIL<sup>2</sup>
                and we don't want to make a copy to be stored - there
                should be only one instance of that instrument. A pointer
                to the instrument to be stored would be added to the
                inventory.)
              <li>
                And if there wasn't enough space in the MILL, then
                they call in carpenters to build an additional bin at
                the end of the row to hold the new instrument.

        </ul>
      <li>When the MIL<sup>2</sup> loans out an instrument, 
        <ul>
          <li>
            it returns the next available instrument (starting at index 0).
          <li>
            That of course leaves an <em>empty bin</em>. We are
            modelling something physical here, so the MILL is not just
            going to "shrink" as instruments are removed.
          <li>
            What if there aren't any left? Hm, if we are
            returning <em>instruments</em>, this is
            difficult. Instead, we could return something
            different. What?  The <em>address</em> of the
            instrument. How does this help? If we don't have any
            instruments we can return <code>nullptr</code>.
          <li>
            it no longer has that instrument in its inventory<br>

            (but the instrument itself still exists, of course) </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each morning before the MIL<sup>2</sup> opens its doors, it
      tests all the instruments in its inventory by making sounds on
      them.<br>

      This is modeled by writing output (shown below).</p>

    <p>
      At the start of the modeling code, the MIL<sup>2</sup> is filled
      with instruments by the modeling programmer - see tester code (link
      below).</p>

    <h3>Instruments</h3>
    <p>
      In the world we are modeling, there are only brass instruments,
      string instruments and percussion instruments.</p>

    <h4>Brass</h4>
    <p>
      Each brass instrument has a mouthpiece which has a size (an
      unsigned). There are three different kinds of brass instruments
      based on the size of their mouthpieces. A mouthpiece may be big,
      12, medium, 9, or small, 4, respectively.  Note the size (12, 9,
      or 4) is provided in the constructor, Perhaps interestlingly (or
      not) there are no other mouthpiece sizes in this world. Making a
      sound is done by blowing on the mouthpiece. We'll model this
      making of sound by writing output on the screen (shown
      below). Another classification of brass instruments is that
      there are trumpets and trombones. They differ from each other in
      the sounds they make when they are played but this will dealt
      with in part two of the recitation.  So there will really be
      nothing except the constructors for trumpets and trombones in
      part one.</p>

    <h4>String</h4>
    <p>
      String instruments in this world have only one string and it has
      a pitch (an unsigned) which is set when the string instrument is
      created and never changes.  For both, making a sound is done by
      bowing the string to produce the pitch.  We'll model this making
      of sound by writing output on the screen (shown below).  The two
      kinds of stringed instruments we have in this world are violins
      and cellos. They differ from each other in the sounds they make
      when played but this will dealt with in part two of the
      recitation. So there will really be nothing except the
      constructors for violins and cellos in part one.</p>

    <h4>Percussion</h4>
    <p>
      Percussions instruments in this world, like most all musical
      worlds are hardly considered real instruments. They have no data
      members. For both, making a sound is done by hitting them.The
      two kinds of percussion instruments we have are drums and
      cymbals which make different sounds when played but this will
      dealt with in part two of the recitation. So there will really
      be nothing except the constructors for drums and cymbals in part
      one.</p>

    <h4>Making Sound</h4>
    <p>All instruments <I>must</I> be able to make sounds.</p>
    <p>
      Specifically we want the output to the screen for making a sound
      to be like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>To MAKE SOUND</u><b>:</b> 
        <ul>
          <li>For all brass instruments the output should also be:<br>
        "<FONT 
    face=Arial>To make a sound... blow on a mouthpiece of size 9</FONT>"<br>

        (9 would be the size of the mouthpiece that this particular
        woodwind instrument has)
      <li>For all string instruments the output should be:<br>
        "<FONT face=Arial>To make a sound... bow a string with pitch 567</FONT>"<BR>
        (567 would be the pitch that this particular stringed instrument has) 
      <li>For all percussion instruments the output should be:<br>
        "<FONT face=Arial>To make a sound... hit me!</FONT>" </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Musicians</h3>
    <p>
      We have provided the code for the Musician class. Musicians can
      obtain instruments from the MIL<SUP>2</SUP> and make sounds on
      them. They can return their instrument to the MIL<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
    <h3>Todo</h3>
    <p>
      Write the class hierarchy for the instrument and MIL<SUP>2</SUP>
      classes. As always, before writing any code you
      should <I>program</I>. Yes, the analysis part is a major part of
      the activity of programming. You should do analysis to determine
      what classes should be created and how they are related.
<!--

Again, TA's feel free to hold the "group problem solving exercise"
below, if you think it is beneficial, but it is not clear to me that
it is.

      (This will be done as a group problem solving exercise.)
-->
    </p>
    <p>
      You will most likely be using inheritance and the virtual
      mechanism wherever possible and wherever it would be needed.<BR>

      You might also need to write code to show the containment and
      association relationships - if there are any!</P>

    <p>
      Recall that in designing with inheritance, you try to move data
      members and methods "up" (towards the base) as far as
      possible.</p>
    <p>
      The object we are most focused on in this recitation is the
      MIL<sup>2</sup>.  Consider the virtual mechanism when
      implementing this class' methods. (Will it have any virtual
      methods itself?) And abstract classes as ways to "enforce" that
      derived classes are consistent.</p>

    <h3>Into the Future!</h3>
    <p>
      For the future (and for those without the requisite musical
      knowledge) <b>:</b></p>
    <p>
      In addition to drums and cymbals, tambour, tambourine,
      grandeCasse, triangle.  bongo, conga, timbale, castanets,
      maracas, guiro, as well as xylophone, orchestra bells, chimes,
      marimba, vibraphone (vibes), crotales and amgloken are in the
      percussion family.</p>
    <p>
      Trumpet, flugelhorn, bugle, trombone, French horn, euphonium, tuba,
      cor de Chasses, sackbutt, zink, and sousaphone are also in the brass
      family.</p>
    <p>
      Other stringed instruments are viola, contrabass violin (bass),
      guitar, lute, banjo, ukelele, balalaika, oud, sitar, zither, and
      kora.</p>
    <p>
      Flute, saxophone, clarinet, oboe, bassoon, shawm, cor Anglais,
      krummhorn and rackett are in the woodwind family which is a kind of
      wind instrument family that is completely different from brass
      instruments - but they are still instruments.</p>
    <p>
      You should write your code so that <U>in the future</U>, if any
      of these kinds of instruments are needed, your C++ program would
      be ready to handle them with no (or almost no) modifications -
      because of the way you wrote your code for the classes using
      inheritance.</P>

    <h3>Develop (and test!) Incrementally</h3>
    <p>
      Here is <a href="cs1124-rec10-PART-ONE.cpp">the tester code</A>
      that tests your classes by declaring some variables and invoking
      some methods. It also contains the Musician class we
      wrote. There is lots of commented out code. Uncomment it little
      by little in the order we have it in the file so that you can
      develop incrementally.<br>

      Add your class definitions to this code.</p>
    <p>
      The tester code is in sections. Only do one section or just one line from 
      a section at a time. Get it to compile and then go on.</p>
    <p>
      To start with, implement only the Instrument class and make sure
      it will compile.  Then implement one class that inherits from
      Instrument and make sure it will compile. And so forth.</p>
    <p>
      Don't bother with separate compilation or namespacing
      today. (You have enough to do.) You may define all methods in the
      class definitions.</p>
    <p>
      After you have working code, try to create some objects of any
      abstract classes you have written. Should this work? Why?</p>
    <hr align=left>
    <p>
      Once all this is working, go on
      to <a href="rec10B.html">PART TWO</a></p>
